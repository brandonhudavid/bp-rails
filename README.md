# bp-rails (Artwork Database)
###### A Rails mini-project for Blueprint.

The idea of the project is to create an artwork database that people can view and contribute to.

## Using the Artwork Database
* The website allows users to create an artwork post if they have an account (they are prompted with a username and password.)
* Account users are also able to edit posts and comments as well as delete them.
* Users without an account can still view posts and contribute to the comments section.
* The website has a Home button at the top right and a link to my website at the top left.


## Built With
* Rails 5.1.4 - Project ideation help from [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-articles).
* [Bootstrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A responsive front-end component library for the CSS.
